# Requesting a package version with upstream repositories<a name="repo-upstream-behavior"></a>

 When a client \(for example, npm\) requests a package version from a CodeArtifact repository named `my_repo` that has multiple upstream repositories, the following can occur: 
+  If `my_repo` contains the requested package version, it is returned to the client\. 
+  If `my_repo` does not contain the requested package version, CodeArtifact looks for it in `my_repo`'s upstream repositories\. If the package version is found, a reference to it is copied to `my_repo`, and the package version is returned to the client\. 
+  If neither `my_repo` nor its upstream repositories contain the package version, an HTTP 404 `Not Found` response is returned to the client\.

 When you add upstream repositories using the `create-repository` or `update-repository` command, the order they are passed to the `--upstreams` parameter determines their priority when a package version is requested\. Specify upstream repositories with `--upstreams` in the order that you want CodeArtifact to use when a package version is requested\. For more information, see [Upstream repository priority order](repo-upstream-search-order.md)\. 

 The maximum number of direct upstream repositories allowed for one repository is 10\. Because direct upstream repositories can also have direct upstream repositories of their own, CodeArtifact can search more than 10 repositories for package versions\. The maximum number of repositories CodeArtifact looks in when a package version is requested is 25\. 

## Package retention from upstream repositories<a name="package-retention-upstream-repos"></a>

 If a requested package version is found in an upstream repository, a reference to it is retained and is always available from the downstream repository\. The retained package version is not affected by any of the following: 
+  Deleting the upstream repository\. 
+  Disconnecting the upstream repository from the downstream repository\. 
+  Deleting the package version from the upstream repository\. 
+  Editing the package version in the upstream repository \(for example, by adding a new asset to it\)\. 

## Fetch packages through an upstream relationship<a name="fetching-packages-through-an-upstream-relationship"></a>

If a CodeArtifact repository has an upstream relationship with a repository that has an external connection, requests for packages not in the upstream repository are copied from the external repository\. For example, consider the following configuration: a repository named `repo-A` has an upstream repository named `repo-B`\. `repo-B` has an external connection to [https://npmjs\.com](https://npmjs.com)\.

![\[Simple upstream repository diagram showing three repositories chained together.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/)![\[Simple upstream repository diagram showing three repositories chained together.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/)![\[Simple upstream repository diagram showing three repositories chained together.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/)

If `npm` is configured to use the `repo-A` repository, running `npm install` triggers the copying of packages from [https://npmjs\.com](https://npmjs.com) into `repo-B`\. The versions installed are also pulled into `repo-A`\. The following example installs `lodash`\.

```
$ npm config get registry
https://my_domain-111122223333.d.codeartifact.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/npm/my-downstream-repo/
$ npm install lodash
+ lodash@4.17.20
added 1 package from 2 contributors in 6.933s
```

After running `npm install`, `repo-A` contains just the latest version \(`lodash 4.17.20`\) because that's the version that was fetched by `npm` from `repo-A`\.

```
aws codeartifact list-package-versions --repository repo-A --domain my_domain \
            --domain-owner 111122223333 --format npm --package lodash
```

Example output:

```
{
    "package": "lodash",
    "format": "npm",
    "versions": [
        {
            "version": "4.17.15",
            "revision": "REVISION-1-SAMPLE-6C81EFF7DA55CC",
            "status": "Published"
        }
    ]
}
```

 Because `repo-B` has an external connection to [https://npmjs\.com](https://npmjs.com), all the package versions that are imported from [https://npmjs\.com](https://npmjs.com) are stored in `repo-B`\. These package versions could have been fetched by any downstream repository with an upstream relationship to `repo-B`\. 

The contents of `repo-B` provide a way to see all the packages and package versions imported from [https://npmjs\.com](https://npmjs.com) over time\. For example, to see all the versions of the `lodash` package imported over time, you can use `list-package-versions`, as follows\.

```
aws codeartifact list-package-versions --repository repo-B --domain my_domain \
            --domain-owner 111122223333 --format npm --package lodash --max-results 5
```

Example output:

```
{
    "package": "lodash",
    "format": "npm",
    "versions": [
        {
            "version": "0.10.0",
            "revision": "REVISION-1-SAMPLE-6C81EFF7DA55CC",
            "status": "Published"
        },
        {
            "version": "0.2.2",
            "revision": "REVISION-2-SAMPLE-6C81EFF7DA55CC",
            "status": "Published"
        },
        {
            "version": "0.2.0",
            "revision": "REVISION-3-SAMPLE-6C81EFF7DA55CC",
            "status": "Published"
        },
        {
            "version": "0.2.1",
            "revision": "REVISION-4-SAMPLE-6C81EFF7DA55CC",
            "status": "Published"
        },
        {
            "version": "0.1.0",
            "revision": "REVISION-5-SAMPLE-6C81EFF7DA55CC",
            "status": "Published"
        }
    ],
    "nextToken": "eyJsaXN0UGFja2FnZVZlcnNpb25zVG9rZW4iOiIwLjIuMiJ9"
}
```

## Package retention in intermediate repositories<a name="package-retention-intermediate-repositories"></a>

 CodeArtifact allows chaining upstream repositories\. For example, `repo-A` can have `repo-B` as an upstream and `repo-B` can have `repo-C` as an upstream\. This configuration makes the package versions in `repo-B` and `repo-C` available from `repo-A`\. 

![\[Simple upstream repository diagram showing three repositories chained together.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/)![\[Simple upstream repository diagram showing three repositories chained together.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/)![\[Simple upstream repository diagram showing three repositories chained together.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/)

 When a package manager connects to repository `repo-A` and fetches a package version from repository `repo-C`, the package version will not be retained in repository `repo-B`\. The package version will only be retained in the most\-downstream repository, in this example, `repo-A`\. It will not be retained in any intermediate repositories\. This is also true for longer chains; for example if there were four repositories `repo-A`, `repo-B`, `repo-C`, and `repo-D` and a package manager connected to `repo-A` fetched a package version from `repo-D`, the package version would be retained in `repo-A` but not in `repo-B` or `repo-C`\. 

 Package retention behavior is similar when pulling a package version from an external repository, except that the package version is always retained in the repository that has the external connection attached\. For example, `repo-A` has `repo-B` as an upstream\. `repo-B` has `repo-C` as an upstream, and `repo-C` also has **npmjs\.com** configured as an external connection; see the followng diagram\.

![\[Upstream repository diagram showing three repositories chained together with an external connection to npmjs.com.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/)![\[Upstream repository diagram showing three repositories chained together with an external connection to npmjs.com.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/)![\[Upstream repository diagram showing three repositories chained together with an external connection to npmjs.com.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/)

 If a package manager connected to `repo-A` requests a package version, *lodash 4\.17\.20* for example, and the package version is not present in any of the three repositories, it will be fetched from **npmjs\.com**\. When *lodash 4\.17\.20* is fetched, it will be retained in `repo-A` as that is the most\-downstream repository and `repo-C` as it has the external connection to **npmjs\.com** attached\. *lodash 4\.17\.20* will not be retained in `repo-B` as that is an intermediate repository\.
